# Triplet Core

This repo contains the open source core parts of the Triplet travel planner app.

The intention is to soon document this library in order to allow people to more easily create applications based on public transport data.

Another intention with releasing this as open source is to allow collaboration on the Triplet clients. The clients are plugins that allow the Triplet Core library to connect to a multitide of travel planner backends.

Currently there are four clients available
[triplet-client-vt](https://github.com/toostn/triplet-client-vt) (Västtrafik, SE)
[triplet-client-skt](https://github.com/toostn/triplet-client-skt) (Skånetrafiken, SE)
[triplet-client-sl](https://github.com/toostn/triplet-client-sl) (Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SE)
[triplet-client-ruter](https://github.com/toostn/triplet-client-no) (Ruter, NO)
